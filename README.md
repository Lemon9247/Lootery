# Lootery

Lootery is a datapack which makes various changes to vanilla loot tables in order to either rebalance them, make them more interesting or make them actually worth looting. Or just simply make sense.

## Loot table changes

### Chests
Lootery changes chest loot in different ways for different reasons:
1. Rebalancing. Buried Treasures, Shipwrecks... The loot was far too great for the point of the game you can find these structures.
2. Immersion. Extra Obsidian in Ruined Portals to help you rebuild what's broken, Kelp and Seagrass in Ocean Ruins, Torches and food in Villages. Changes like these are made to most chest loot tables in Lootery.
3. Incentive. Rarer structures now have far greater loot to make up for their scarceness. Uncommon structures like Woodland Mansions, Pillager Outposts and Jungle Temples loot has been massively buffed to promote finding them.
4. Ease. The primary change in this category is increasing the odds of finding Smithing Templates in chests. For example, Silence Smithing Template now has a 10% chance to generate in chests instead of a measly 1.2%, while Trims found in rarer structures have a 100% chance to be found there.

### Entities
- **Ghasts** drop more Ghast Tears, up to 4 at once, because Ghasts are far too rare to only drop 1.
- **Blazes** have a chance to drop additional Blaze Powder or Glowstone Dust.
- **Shulkers** may drop both of their Shulker Shells, instead of one of them mysteriously vanishing.
- **Drowneds** may drop Prismarine Shards.
- **Husks** may drop Sand.
- **Withers** drop a lot of extra Coal, Soul Sand and Soul Soil.
- **Piglins** may drop Gold Nuggets and Gold Ingots at the same odds as Zombified Piglins.
- **Wandering Traders** drop 2 - 6 Emeralds on death.
- **Villagers** and **Zombie Villagers** sometimes drop Sticks, Wheat Seeds or rarely Emeralds on death.
- **Pillagers** can drop 0 - 2 Arrows.
- **Guardian** and **Elder Guardians** no longer drop fish. Increased Prismarine drop amounts.
- **Cave Spiders** drop less loot than regular Spiders, because, well, they are quarter their size.
- **Pandas** drop 0 - 2 Bamboo instead of always 1 for parity with Bedrock Edition.

### Other
- Tamed Cats are more likely to bring Phantom Membranes in the morning.
- Sniffers have a 50% chance to dig up extra seeds.
- Piglins have slightly expanded selection of items for bartering.
    - They can now also give Ribs and Netherite Upgrade smithing templates.
- Tweaked archaeology loot tables so they make more sense. How did an Iron Axe survive all this long in an underwater ruin and it isn't even slightly rusted?
